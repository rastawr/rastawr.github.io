These are a few of the projects I have worked on recently!

### VR Locomotion Study

The purpose of this study was to determine the how different users felt about different ways of moving in a virtual enviornment! I helped to build the On-Rails form of movement within a museum enviornment from the "Teenie Harris Archive", a project focused on displaying historical pieces by the Pittsburgh photorapher Teenie Harris, as well as the UI that displays and explains the instructions for the step of the study the user is currently on. The results from user interviews will help to determine the locomotion system for the "Teenie Harris Archive", and will also be used for the "Story Worlds 3D" project, which is focused on visualizing stories from Ecuador. In being used for these two projects, this study will also serve as a basis for "The Playable Archive". 

["The Playable Archive!"]: Explain what it is, with something like ", which is a yadayadayada"

[Don't explain what I did]: The text part of explaining it is in a resume, make a video and use a small amount of text for further explanation as opposed to talking over it, for the sake of presentation. Also it might look good if they know I know how to edit video stuff, though idk how much that will help me
