These are a few of the projects I have worked on recently!

[make a new email]: to put on resume and porfolio
[FOR ALL OF THE BELOW]: figure out how to embed images(and maybe videos)
[FOR ALL OF THE BELOW]: Figure out how to embed links
### VR Locomotion Study

The purpose of this study was to determine the how different users felt about different ways of moving in a virtual enviornment! I helped to build the On-Rails form of movement within a museum enviornment from the "Teenie Harris Archive", a project focused on displaying historical pieces by the Pittsburgh photorapher Teenie Harris, as well as the UI that displays and explains the instructions for the step of the study the user is currently on. The results from user interviews will help to determine the locomotion system for the "Teenie Harris Archive", and will also be used for the "Story Worlds 3D" project, which is focused on visualizing stories from Ecuador. In being used for these two projects, this study will also serve as a basis for "The Playable Archive". 

["The Playable Archive!"]: Explain what it is, with something like ", which is a yadayadayada"

[add screenshots]: and maybe make a video

[Don't explain what I did]: The text part of explaining it is in a resume, make a video and use a small amount of text for further explanation as opposed to talking over it, for the sake of presentation. Also it might look good if they know I know how to edit video stuff, though idk how much that will help me

### TurnKey Learning HealthCare Portal

I worked with the folks at TurnKey Learning to make a software application that allows medical workers to record their patients' diagnoses. The user interface is different for each level of worker in a way that is tailored to their job description. It also visualizes the data from the patients in multiple forms, such as tables and line, bar, and pie charts, and scatterplots. While I am under a Nondisclosure Agreement, you can learn more about Turnkey Learning HERE.

[explain what i did but non-vaguely]: a

[link turnkey site]: maybe specifically the healthcare section? or maybe the main page, we shall site

[mention that i cant share screenshots or antyhing cuz of nda]: i think it was an nda at least

### Three Little Pigs: RELOADED

Three Little Pigs: RELOADED is a 2D top-down bullet-hell game that follows the story of the Three Little Pigs from the wolf's perspective, except in this timeline, the pigs are armed! The wolf needs to blow each house down by shooting puffs of air while dodging the bullets fired by the pig. There are three houses to blow down, and because each pig runs to the next house when theirs is blown down, each house has more pigs firing at the wolf!
My next plan of action for this game is to resize the boundries to make it more vertical. This way, the bullets will have less power in restricting the wolf's movement, meaning that I can give each pig a secondary attack!

[Make Itch.io Page]: Also make title card and get screenshots for the store, as well as maybe upload Miles' video. Also add Miles as a developer

[For now, just link the github]: do itch later!

### Grandpa is Gone

Grandpa is Gone is a 2D side-scrolling platforming game made for the 2023 GamesForSocialImpact Game Jam! Grandpa is Gone follows a boy named Carl who's grandpa suddenly disappeared. In looking for him, he finds an amulet that lets him turn into his grandpa! As he navigates different puzzles, he learns that he can be his own grandpa, and that his grandfather being gone does not mean that Carl is alone.

[Mention that I worked with team]: i dont know if i always have to include somthing after the brackets but in case i do here we go

[Talk about the plot]: talk about what was and wasn't included in the final submission (this might mean replaying the game)

[talk about what wouldve been added with more time or wouldve been done differently mechanics wise]: saying "want to" would acutally work cuz this was for a game jam

[Mention the award]: of course.

### Copyright Strike

Copyright Strike is a 2D top-down hack-and-slash made for the 2024 GamesForSocialImpact Game Jam. It was made with two other programmers, an artist, and a storywriter. A lot was planned for this game, but due to the nature of game jams, we weren't able to get a lot of it into the final cut. That being said, we still want to flesh this project out in the future. The itch.io page containing the artwork and storyline seems to have dissappeared on us. We are working to get it back up, but in the meantime, the art and story files can be found at the bottom of this section. That being said, I'd like to talk about what all we had planned in terms of game mechanics (the planned narrative and artwork can be found on the itch.io page!):

[Change last sentence later]



[Talk about the plot]: kind of goes into the "what all was planned" thing

[Mention that I worked with team]: i dont know if i always have to include somthing after the brackets but in case i do here we go

[Talk about what all was planned(mechanics wise/stuff not in the itch page)]: Maybe frame it like a proof of concept?? prolly not but make sure the idea gets across since the game itself is barely a game

[Briefly mention/list planned stuff that is in the itch page]: and also mention it can be found there

[Maybe talk about issues faced???]: very tentative probably dont do this actually
