These are a few of the projects I have worked on recently!

[make a new email]: to put on resume and porfolio
[FOR ALL OF THE BELOW]: figure out how to embed images(and maybe videos)

### VR Locomotion Study

The purpose of this study was to determine the how different users felt about different ways of moving in a virtual enviornment! I helped to build the On-Rails form of movement within a museum enviornment from the "Teenie Harris Archive", a project focused on displaying historical pieces by the Pittsburgh photorapher Teenie Harris, as well as the UI that displays and explains the instructions for the step of the study the user is currently on. The results from user interviews will help to determine the locomotion system for the "Teenie Harris Archive", and will also be used for the "Story Worlds 3D" project, which is focused on visualizing stories from Ecuador. In being used for these two projects, this study will also serve as a basis for "The Playable Archive", which is a museum in virtual space that contains contents from existing archives.

### TurnKey Learning HealthCare Portal

I worked with the folks at TurnKey Learning to make a software application that allows medical workers to record their patients' diagnoses. The user interface is different for each level of worker in a way that is tailored to their job description. It also visualizes the data from the patients in multiple forms, such as tables and line, bar, and pie charts, and scatterplots. While I am under a non-disclosure agreement, you can learn more about Turnkey Learning <a href="https://turnkeylearning.com/industries/healthcare/">here</a>.

### Three Little Pigs: RELOADED

Three Little Pigs: RELOADED is a 2D top-down bullet-hell game that follows the story of the Three Little Pigs from the wolf's perspective, except in this timeline, the pigs are armed! The wolf needs to blow each house down by shooting puffs of air while dodging the bullets fired by the pig. There are three houses to blow down, and because each pig runs to the next house when theirs is blown down, each house has more pigs firing at the wolf!

My main focus was on implementing the projectiles and their movement patterns. If I were to continue development for this game, my next plan of action would be to resize the boundries to make it more vertical. This way, the bullets would have less power in restricting the wolf's movement, meaning that I could give each pig a secondary attack! Once this is implemented, there would be enough projectiles being spawned and destroyed that I would have to worry about memory management. The next step would thus be to use object pools to reuse instances of projectiles that are no longer active in the gamescene, thus minimizing the amount of allocations and garbage collections 

### Grandpa is Gone

<a href="https://justaglitch.itch.io/grandpa-is-gone">Grandpa is Gone</a> is a 2D side-scrolling platforming game made for the 2023 GamesForSocialImpact Game Jam! Grandpa is Gone follows a boy named Carl who's grandpa suddenly disappeared. In looking for him, he finds an amulet that lets him turn into his grandpa! As he navigates different puzzles, he learns that he can be his own grandpa, and that his grandfather being gone does not mean that Carl is alone.

This game won the award for Best Narrative Design!

### Copyright Strike

Copyright Strike is a 2D top-down hack-and-slash game made for the 2024 GamesForSocialImpact Game Jam. It follows Robin, a young goblin who has an idea for what could be a revolutionary product! However, upon trying to publish it, he's told that some CEO already patented not the idea itself, but rather the entire category that the idea falls under. So what does Robin do in response? He goes to the CEO's headquarters with his trusty club, and strikes everyone with it until he reaches the CEO!

This game was made with two other programmers, an artist, and a storywriter. A lot was planned for this game, but due to the nature of game jams, we weren't able to get a lot of it into the final cut. That being said, we still want to flesh this project out in the future. The itch.io page containing the artwork and storyline seems to have dissappeared on us. We are working to get it back up, but in the meantime, I'd like to talk about what we had planned in terms of game mechanics:
* The ablity to choose the type of product that Robin wants to make at the beginning of the game.
    *  This choice would give Robin a corresponding advantage, similiar to how you can choose from a few starter boons/relics in some Roguelike games. We had two product categories in mind:
        1. A pharmasuetical product: this would give Robin a high amount of health points.
        2. A technological product: this would allow Robin to deal a high amount of damage.
* The ability to choose whether to kill or spare an worker (the enemy) after beating them
    * This would of course have an effect on the gameplay, but we quickly realized we would have to forgo this idea in the interest of time.
* After clearing each stage room, Robin's bat would become comically larger, allowing him to have more reach.
* A final boss: Steve Gobbs, the CEO who put a patent on the entire field of either tenchology or medicine.
